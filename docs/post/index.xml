      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently had a series of tweets about learning to do data science work from a non-traditional background, and since there’s nothing easier than turning a tweet-storm into a blog post I thought I’d formalize it a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a pretty strange data science background. In my career I’ve sold electric razors, worked on credit derivatives during the 2008 financial crash, written market reports on orthopaedic biomaterials, and then became a lawyer. I started programming in R during law school partially as a way to learn more about data visualization and partially to help analyze youth criminal justice data. Over time I liked programming more and more and liked law less and less and decided to make the switch to data work about two years ago. Since then I’ve freelanced a bit, worked as a Data Scientist at Upworthy, and now am a Senior R Developer at a survey company called Crunch.io.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started the process, I honestly didn’t have any particular skills or capacity which would make data science a good career choice. I studied Philosophy in undergrad, and while I had done a bit of statistics it wasn’t something I would have said I was comfortable with. All I really had was an interest and the capacity to learn new things. If you’re in a similar boat here is some advice about the process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emulate one or two people who know what they’re doing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a huge diversity of tools and techniques for approaching data work, and if you half-learn a lot of different techniques you won’t be able to fully understand or accomplish any one technique. My recommendation is to pick one or two people who work in the field and who speak in a language that you can understand and try to emulate them. In my case I really focused on learning the R programming language, and picked a few R programmers to follow. I listened to all of their online talks, read their blogs and follows their activity on Github. What this meant is that I ended up with a deep understanding of a few small areas of the language and missed out on a lot of other areas For instance I learned &lt;code&gt;dplyr&lt;/code&gt; really well, but didn’t learn much abut object oriented programming. It’s good to try to develop depth of knowledge rather than breadth because when you know one thing very well you can usually apply that knowledge to other areas, but a shallow understanding of many areas won’t help you tackle advanced problems in any one area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Learning to code” and “learning statistics” are terrible goals because they have no end point.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you are learning a new skill it is important to have success criteria that can be accomplished. This helps keep you on track and also helps mitigate imposter syndrome because you don’t move the goal posts as you develop your understanding. From this perspective “learning to code” and “learning statistics” are terrible goals because there’s always more to learn about these fields. It’s better to have smaller goals like “Learn to write a function in R” or “Be able to fit a linear model” because those things can be accomplished. Goals which can be accomplished are good things because you can accomplish them, rather than constantly remembering how far you have to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on trajectory, not position&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also naturally compare ourselves to others and tend to judge our own skills in terms of other people’s skills. The problem with this is that as our understanding improves we tend to change our comparators to more and more accomplished people. This is especially a problem when we compare our own general understanding of an area to that of specialists. For instance you might have a good general understanding of neural networks, but if you compare yourself to someone who studies them full time your unstanding will obviously be pretty paltry. This kind of comparative thinking leads to always feeling insufficient because no matter who you are or how much you know there is always somebody who will know more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A better approach is to focus on trajectory. Ask whether you are making progress rather than whether you are relatively successful. Think about what you knew yesterday and feel good if you learned a bit more today. Over time that approach will lead to much better understanding with a lot less suffering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow Kind Experts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every field has experts, and many of those experts are assholes. Indeed in our society we frequently use lack of empathy or kindness as a sign of intelligence or accomplishment. We call these people “geniuses” or “rockstars” and try to forgive their personal faults by pointing to their intellectual accomplishments. I think you should ignore these people and instead try to find experts who have a genuine concern for other people. There are two reasons for this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kind experts will help you learn. This is common sense, if somebody has a genuine concern for helping other people understand an area the resources they produce will be better at teaching other people how to do that thing. Moreover the community of learners that surrounds these people is going to be supportive and rather than combative and so engaging with that community will be a good experience&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kind people know more than unkind people. This is a bit less intuitive, but just as important. Experts who are genuinely concerned with other people tend to create environments where other people help them. A good example of this is Hadley Wickham’s Twitter feed. What you notice following him is that he is for the most part very kind in how he communicates with other people. The result of this is that he has developed a powerful network of people who answer his questions, test and provide feedback on his software projects, and grow into kind experts themselves. Most of the really productive developers I have interacted with have these same kinds of networks, and the reason they have them is that they spend a lot of time and energy supporting people rather than belittling them. No matter how brilliant a brilliant jerk is, they will always always lose out to a group of people working together on a problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try to Ignore Boundary Setting Behaviour&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boundary setting behaviour is when people who are part of a group attempt to draw the lines around that group to include themselves and exclude you. For instance programmers sometimes say things like “real programmers use the command line” or “you really need to learn &lt;language&gt; if you want to be a programmer. The motivation for this is not to accurate express the boundaries of the discipline, but instead to make themselves feel better about their own skills. Most of the time people will express the importance of their own skills and minimize the importance of skills they lack. People are insecure, and about half of the stuff you read is written to address that insecurity rather than help you learn. If possible you should try to avoid this kind of advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I say “try to ignore” instead of “ignore” because you will definitely encounter it. You will get rejected from jobs, or made to feel like an idiot because of this kind of behaviour and there’s nothing you can really do about that. My own experience of this has been applying for data science jobs from a weird background, I will frequently encounter people who believe all of the following&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data manipulation, visualization, and communication are the most common data science tasks;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We should focus on building teams with distinct capacities rather than trying to find one person who knows how to do everything;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most of the time you want a simple linear model, not a complex machine learning algorithm;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a labour shortage for data science roles and we should expand the applicant pool; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is absolutely essential that you have an advanced degree in statistics to apply for a job at my company&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now there’s a way that all of these things can be true at the same time, but more likely than not #1-4 describe a lot of the actual job requirements, and #5 is boundary setting. But when you apply for and get rejected from the job you can’t really ignore that behaviour, you have to deal with it emotionally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the key ways you can recognize boundary setting behaviour is when people start to equate being a member of a profession with being a particularly good member of that profession. For instance someone might tell you that you be a real data scientist you need to have a PHD in statistics, and have mastered R, Python, and big-data query languages, and be an exceptional written and verbal communicator. Having these skills probably makes you an extremely skilled data scientist, but are they really hard boundaries around the profession? I’m not so sure. In most cases we talk about jobs based on the job title, rather than the job requirements. If you’re a baseball player who stands near first base we call you a first baseman, if you write for a living we call you a writer. These things are true even if you write trashy science fiction novels or are a terrible fielder. The boundaries of the profession are set by the market not by your skills, and so you can be a good or bad example of the profession without having that change your membership in that profession. I think the same thing should be true of programming. Can you get a job writing computer programs? Then you’re a programmer. Do you work with data for a living? You can probably call yourself a data scientist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learn to Bounce Back&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main currency in learning a new skill is enthusiasm. Each time you have some success you bank a bit of enthusiasm, and each time you experience challenges you lose a little bit of it. It is important to try to understand what helps you gain energy and enthusiasm and what helps you lose it. Whenever you notice that you’re going into the red in the enthusiasm department, either take a break or do something that helps you feel a bit better. Here are some of the things I do when I feel bleak about my abilities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take a walk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take a nap&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise for five minutes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Answer easy stack overflow questions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I’m frustrated by a computer problem I copy and paste the examples and run them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meditate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the key to this is not so much what particular things you do to bounce back but that you recognize when you are losing energy for a task and stop attempting to learn. It turns out that strss basically obliterates our ability to learn new things and so simply stopping for a bit is a powerful way to maintain our capacity for new skills.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why you should work remotely, even if you&#39;re not remote</title>

      <guid>/2017/05/03/why-you-should-work-remotely-even-if-youre-not-remote/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My last job was as a data scientist at Upworthy, which is a 100% remote company. Prior to starting the position I was worried about whether I could be happy and productive on a remote team. I wondered how project planning would work, whether it would be terribly lonely, and how communication would function when things got hectic. What I discovered is that the company was one of the more efficient and friendly places that I’ve worked, and I think the changes that they have made to accommodate remote work deserve much of the credit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most companies who hire remote employees do so to take advantage of cheaper labour markets. If you are a Silicon Valley tech company and are able to hire remotely you will be able to hire from areas which are not experiencing a labour shortage and as a result you will able to hire better people for less money. The thing which prevents companies from taking advantage of this opportunity is that they are afraid that remote work will disrupt the company’s workflow. How will they organize projects across multiple time zones? How will we come up with ideas if we have no watercoolers? I think that most of the changes required to accommodate remote employees are actually independent goods which every company should adopt. And since I learned all this at Upworthy, I’m going to present these benefits as a listical with cute animal pictures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;../img/cadence_smiling.jpg&#34; id=&#34;id&#34; class=&#34;class&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;200&#34; /&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;four-ways-that-remote-work-helps-your-company&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Four Ways that Remote Work Helps Your Company&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;results-orientation&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1) Results orientation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results oriented work environments are those which only care about employee &lt;em&gt;output&lt;/em&gt; and do not care about their effort. In these environments it doesn’t matter if an employee leaves early or checks Facebook at work so long as their results are good. This makes a lot of sense because ultimately, the company, as a whole is judged on its results, and so an employee’s work should be judged relative to how it contributes to those results. The problem is that defining results for an employee is a hard job, and it’s much easier to judge people based on their effort. Most companies which say they are results focused still use this heuristic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remote work makes results-orientation mandatory. The simple fact that you can’t tell if or when your remote employees are at their desk means that managers have no choice but to evaluate employees based on their work product. As a result employees have incentives to make their work more efficient, for instance by taking short naps after lunch. &lt;img src=&#34;../img/cadence_gordon.jpg&#34; id=&#34;id&#34; class=&#34;class&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;200&#34; /&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;intentional-communication&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2) Intentional communication&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you work with a remote team you have to be intentional about your communication. If you are having a bad day or have run into a block of some kind, you have you proactively tell other people about it. Nobody is going to walk by your desk and notice why you are frustrated, and so you have to be intentional about asking for help, and connecting with your colleagues. My team at Upworthy did this, in part, by scheduling weekly one-on-one video calls between different engineers. These were a half-hour long, and the only requirement was that you not talk about work. We also did things like daily Slack check-ins and making sure to start meetings by spending a bit of time asking how everyone was doing. There’s an assumption that this kind of informal communication happens automatically at in-person offices, but I don’t think that’s actually true. It might be true that some employees are making some connections, but most employees don’t actually end up connecting with a wide slice of their colleagues. This kind of intentional communication is connection and emotional safety. People develop better relationships with one another, and so they are more likely to ask for help or raise a dissenting view. Because remote work brings the problem of disconnection into sharper focus, it provides an incentive to build structures which help people connect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is an example of my dog Cadence engaging in intentional communication through a digital platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/n8vhraccEnc&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;continuous-documentation&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3) Continuous documentation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remote work environments promote asynchronous communication. You spend more time communicating through email, Slack, or other written media than through conversation. Even video conferences involve a substantial amount of written communication. For instance at Upworthy we would frequently keep collaborative meetings notes in a Dropbox Paper document, or create Jira tickets as tasks were being assigned during the meeting. This is in contrast to in-person work environments where a lot of the work assignment takes place through verbal communication either at a meeting or through your boss dropping by your desk to ask you to do something. These synchronous bits of communication then need to be documented if anyone’s going to keep track of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The great thing about remote communication is that teams are constantly producing written artifacts which are easy to turn into documentation. For instance, you never forget what exactly your boss asked you to do because work assignments almost always include a written description. It’s also easy to move from a brainstorming document used at a meeting, to a working document discussing a system, to a polished bit of documentation about that system. Because everyone works in text all the time, there’s a lower cost to creating documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;../img/cadence_glasses.jpg&#34; id=&#34;id&#34; class=&#34;class&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;200&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;support-for-diversity&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4) Support for diversity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost every tech company has a major diversity problem. This is bad both from a basic ethical perspective but also because it causes teams to ignore perspectives other than their own. Structuring your company to promote remote work is, in my opinion, the single biggest action that you can take to promote diversity. There are two main ways that it does this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;remote-work-accommodates-diverse-workplace-requirements&#34; class=&#34;section level4&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Remote work accommodates diverse workplace requirements&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Workplaces are path-dependent places. You start your company with a few employees, and then make decisions about how that workplace develops physically and socially based on those employees. These decisions in turn attract employees who like those work environments and the cycle continues. For instance, it’s very likely that your open-concept, start-up office with a climbing wall and beer in the fridge is tailored to support the work of able-bodied young men. Probably you won’t make the investments to support the work of, say, a blind engineer who needs to code by voice, and so you will never hire that engineer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same thing is true for geography. A small or midsized company tends to pick office locations based on where their current employees want to work, and so tend to hire people from particular neighborhoods, because that office location is convenient to those neighborhoods. This embeds a fair amount of socioeconomic and ethnic bias into your workplace because neighborhoods tend to be ethically and socio-economically segregated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a kind of Catch-22 for workplace accommodation: you don’t know what to change if none of your employees need accommodation, but you won’t be able to hire employees who need accommodation if you haven’t made those changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simple solution is to just let an employee determine their own work environment. If someone has a particular workplace need, it’s very likely that their home already meets that need. If they need a quiet environment to code by voice, they will be able to find or create that space when you let them work remotely. If they need to be close to their children or ailing parents, they will be able to do that. Similarly your company can hire from communities which are geographically removed from your current work neighborhoods which increases diversity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;reducing-bias&#34; class=&#34;section level4&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Reducing bias&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before getting into this, I should say that I have almost no personal experience with bias in the workplace. That said, I’m lawyer with some experience in human rights litigation and can speak from that perspective. The thing you notice again and again with human rights disputes is that bias flourishes in areas with poor evidence. It’s hard to prove workplace discrimination, because this discrimination often happens informally and usually without witnesses. Claimants have a hard time reporting a discriminatory conduct, because they are justifiably worried that they won’t be believed without some kind of smoking gun bit of evidence. Since the assholes of the world are well aware of this fact, they tend to do their harassing in circumstances where it will be hard to prove the conduct. Because remote work funnels more communication through channels which leave a paper trail, it reduces the amount communication which is amendable to this kind of discriminatory conduct. If someone harasses their female coworker through Slack or email, it’s very easy for that coworker to forward that communication on to human resources or a labour lawyer. It’s also easier to correct people for inadvertantly saying or doing something discriminatory, because you have a record to look back on to identify what exactly was wrong with their behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can probably think of other ways that remote work helps with bias. For instance results-orientation might lead to more evidence-based promotion decisions, women might be better able to better integrate their professional life with gendered, non-professional work like child care, or text-based communication might ameliorate implicit bias. I have a suspicion that these factors are valid, but have neither data nor experience to support that suspicion so, will leave it at that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accommodating diversity extends beyond people who you typically think of as requiring accommodation. Almost everybody’s work-life could be improved if that work fit their life circumstances a bit better. For instance, I have a tiny dog who will only go to the vet if she’s carried in a satchel. Remote work accommodates that particular life circumstance:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Data Visualization and UI design</title>
      <link>/2017/04/13/data-visualization-and-ui-design/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 13 Apr 2017 21:48:51 -0700</pubDate>
      <author>g.e.shotwell@gmail.com (Gordon Shotwell)</author>
      <guid>/2017/04/13/data-visualization-and-ui-design/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the past couple of months, I’ve been rebuilding the &lt;a href=&#34;http://app.shambhala.org&#34;&gt;Shambhala Meditation Timer&lt;/a&gt; using React Native and Redux. The idea behind the Shambhala app was to create a kind of modular framework for building meditation timers in order to allow people to create complex timers out of simple components. The three build blocks for a timer are time intervals, gong sounds, and recorded audio contemplations, and the user can stack these building blocks to create whatever kind of meditation session they want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I think the basic idea of the initial app was a good one, the implementation had a lot of problems. The user interface was confusing and there were a lot of counter-intuitive design decisions. Since I was the source of most of these decisions, I thought the release of version 2.0 of the app would be a good opportunity to write down some of the things I’ve learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started programming in R because I was interested in data visualization, and what I’ve noticed working on this iteration of the Shambhala App is how much overlap there is between data visualization and user interface design. In particular there are three slogans that I’ve found useful for both problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) Minimize the ink to information ratio&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a slight restatement of one of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/&#34;&gt;Edward Tufte’s&lt;/a&gt; famous data visualization principles. The idea is that you should aim to be as efficient as possible with how much space you use to present your data. If you are selecting between different ways of displaying data, the best bet is to select the one which uses the least ink. This principle tends to pull you towards using lighter shapes to express data. For instance these two charts show the same information, but from a Tuftean perspective the one on the left is better because it displays the same information with less ink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;../post/ui_data_analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png&#34; width=&#34;1152&#34; /&gt; The way this principle applies to UI design is to be efficient with the visual attention of your user. The user only has so much time and attention to devote to your application and they tend to like applications which don’t waste that attention. If you can convey the same amount of information with fewer visual items, then that will tend to improve the user experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) Make use of Idioms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Idioms are bits of language whose meaning derives from their use rather than their content. For instance the phrase “It’s a piece of cake” is pretty confusing when read literally, but it communicates quite a lot because of how it’s typically used. The same is true in visual communication. People get used to certain shapes representing certain types of information, and it’s often better to go along with those preconceptions rather than trying to change them. For instance, the bar chart above is less efficient at communicating the data, but people tend to associate bar charts with counts, and so it’s often a good choice when you are communicating counts of a categorical variable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In user interface design, this principle implies that you should pick your battles in terms of creating new visual forms. Make your buttons look like buttons, and your forms look like forms. A bad UI artifact that your user already understands is usually better than a great one that they need to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3) If you have to explain something, you have a design problem&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest problems in both data visualization and user interface design is reducing mistakes. People don’t spend that long looking at visual displays of information, and so it’s important to focus their attention on what’s important. Here is a good example from &lt;a href=&#34;http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/stephen-curry-is-the-revolution/&#34;&gt;fivethirtyeight&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;../img/steph_curry.png&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s almost impossible to make a mistake reading this chart. The message it’s trying to send is that Steph Curry is having a way better season than you would expect, and the visuals of the chart convey that perfectly. There’s Steph, in bright yellow, way above the crowd of other players. It would be easy to add more information to this chart, for instance by coloring the chart by position, but doing so would create confusion. The design of the chart eliminates the need for that kind of explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bad chart on this metric is something like this one of reading, writing, and income in the United States:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;../img/US.png&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a kind of interesting idea for a chart. The main map is a projection of the three small maps aimed at showing how the three factors interact. For instance if an area is high in reading and writing but low in income, it will be orange because it’s a mixture of pink and yellow. However, the overall effect is immensely confusing because it’s not clear what we’re supposed to be looking at. Because the reader’s scarce attention isn’t directed, it’s frustrating to try to understand the chart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the UI space, this principle often takes the form of controlling a user’s decisions. For instance if the user is in a place where it doesn’t make sense for them to push the save button, then don’t show them the save button. By reducing the number of options, you can guarantee that the user will not make mistakes. Usually a good warning sign that your UI is breaking this rule is when you start thinking about adding some text to explain what the user should do. If you have to explain, you probably have a design problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;shambhala-app-home-screen&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Shambhala App Home Screen&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;../img/main_old.gif&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initial version of the app had a black and white video of a flag playing behind the main menu. I personally liked the look of this screen quite a lot because it had a nice texture to it, and visually highlighted the history and tradition of the Shambhala community. This was also pretty much the only part of the app which was universally loved by our user testers so it was hard to say goodbye to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with the screen is that it has a very poor information-to-ink ratio. Most of the ‘ink’, or visual bandwidth, is taken up by the flag flapping in the background. It’s a moving, interesting image, and so it occupies a lot of the user’s attention. However, it provides no informational content beyond setting the context for the application. Since the video doesn’t really tell the user very much about what they should do or what they are doing, the attention they spend on it is somewhat wasted. The video was the design equivalent of empty calories: it tastes good but doesn’t provide much nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After taking out the video, I still wanted to maintain that kind of textured look, and thought that a brocade image might make a nice background. Brocade is used as framing for Buddhist paintings in India and Tibet, and so also has a a traditional feel. After trying a few different options we came up with one which provides a similar feel as the video, but without the visual clutter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;../img/main_new.png&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;session-builder&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Session Builder&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main function of the app is that it lets you create timers by stacking different blocks together. This is a useful but novel way of constructing a timer, so it’s important that the visuals of the session builder are clear. Unfortunately, what we ended up with wasn’t that clear:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;../img/builder_old.jpeg&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each block on this screen represents a time segment which is either a time interval, a gong, or an audio recording of some meditation instructions. The problem with this screen is that we’re using the wrong idiom. Functionally, this screen is a swipable list like Google Inbox, but the initial design made it look like a bunch of buttons. It’s natural for the user to tap on each block as though they were buttons, but it’s not natural to use the swipe functionality to delete a block. In order to fix this I made use of visual idioms related to swipable lists. This included adding in little square icons and making the text portion of the block a standard colour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;../img/builder_new.png&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;the-player&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Player&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The player screen on the app was the biggest visual improvement. The idea behind the player was that we would show the user a graph of their meditation session, so they could see how much time each block would take to play. It was also important to link the two screens together visually so that the user could understand the relationship between them. The initial block did this by expanding the height of each block proportional to its length, but in the new app we went with a simpler doughnut chart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;../img/player_old.jpeg&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This illustrates all three slogans. First, the initial design of the player invited explanation. You wanted to say “no, those aren’t buttons, they represent the relative time for each block. And see? their outline changes colour when they are playing.” Additionally there are lots of buttons on the bottom which are only useful some of the time. Second, it is has a terrible information-to-ink ratio. The data visualization occupies almost all of the available pixels, but doesn’t really communicate all that much. Finally, it doesn’t use the right visual idioms, again using the ‘button’ idiom when we want something that says ‘timer’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The revised screen does a much better job. It shows the relative time of each block in a pie chart around a big Play/Pause button, and the time remaining on the session is shown by changing the opacity of the timer. By doing this we use way less digital ink to show the same amount of information, and make use of a standard idiom for timer which is a circle with a button in the center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;../img/player_new.png&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;script src=&#34;../rmarkdown-libs/dt-core/js/jquery.dataTables.min.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;


&lt;div id=&#34;tidy-data&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Tidy Data&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tidy data has become the dominant way of thinking about problems in R. The idea behind tidy data is to develop an &lt;a href=&#34;http://tidyverse.org/&#34;&gt;ecosystem&lt;/a&gt; of R packages which all work around a similar kind of data structure. That way you can easily compose many different tools together to accomplish very complex tasks in an iterative, easy to understand fashion. There are lots of excellent presentations about why this is a great approach but the one I would recommend if you are new to this area is Hadley Wickham’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rstudio.com/resources/videos/data-science-in-the-tidyverse/&#34;&gt;keynote&lt;/a&gt; from the 2017 rstudio conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One problem with data analysis is that you often need to make critical decisions before you really understand the problem. Since data analysis is always somewhat exploratory you can often make some bad decisions in the early stages of your analysis which can cause lots of problems later on. Maybe at some point you thought that storing your data in a nested list was a good idea, but curse yourself when you try to draw a graph with that data. Because you don’t know the optimal form for your data when you start working with it, you can end up is some ugly places. The great thing about Tidy Data is that it gives you a really good set of first steps which will rarely lead you astray. No matter where your analysis goes, a nice tidy dataset will be your arrow against misfortune.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first articulation of tidy data which I read was from this &lt;a href=&#34;http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf&#34;&gt;Hadley Wickham paper&lt;/a&gt;. A tidy dataset is one in which:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each variable forms a column.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each observation forms a row.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each type of observational unit forms a table.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would add a fourth consideration:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;4&#34; style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The information is expressed as simply as practicable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This fourth consideration is really just a restatement of the other three, but it is still a very helpful way of thinking about your data which often reveals subtle problems. For instance you can ask whether you are duplicating information in your data sets and whether removing that duplication simplifies the data. Another common simplification is referring to information consistently for instance by changing all of the &lt;code&gt;Mon&lt;/code&gt;’s to &lt;code&gt;Monday&lt;/code&gt;’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever I start a new data analysis I look at my data and ask whether it’s tidy, and if it’s not, I do the work splitting up strings, reshaping tables, and joining data sets together to get it into a tidy form. This often feels like a waste of time because you are not immediately providing analytical value, but it almost always pays off in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tidying data is powerful both because it allows you to use all the great tidyverse packages, but also because it forces you to ask important questions about your data. To get each column to represent a variable you need to know what the variables are. Maybe the unit of observation is not obvious and you need more information about how the data is collected. Maybe you don’t really know how observations can go missing or how missing data is treated. Asking these questions right at the beginning of an analysis helps to clairify what you are trying to do and save time and mistakes down the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;convertr-example&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Convertr Example&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to provide an example of how data tidying can lead to faster, simpler code. My first foray into R package development was a unit converter called &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/ropenscilabs/convertr&#34;&gt;convertr&lt;/a&gt; the idea behind this package was to allow users to convert between as many units as possible, and as a result I needed to pull together lots of different data sources into a common data structure. I needed all of the scientific units from one place, all of the engineering units from another, all of the medieval English units from another place etc. The first question then was, how do you store all of this data? What form should it take? One natural option is a conversion matrix:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;library(convertr)

&lt;p&gt;This table is great for printing out and looking up units by hand. If you wanted to convert firkins to kilderkins all you do is look up firkins in the column name and kilderkin in the row name and look for the conversion factor stored in the cell value. While intuitive, this dataset is not tidy because the observations do not form a row, and the variables are not stored in columns. For this problem the two variable are probably the unit that we are converting from, the unit we are converting to, and the conversion factor, so we want to transform this from its current wide format to a long format with only three columns. This is what the &lt;code&gt;tidyr&lt;/code&gt; package is for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This data is a little tidier but there’s still a ways to go. Now we have the variables in the column names, but each row is not an observation we can express the information more simply. The first thing you notice is that we have each conversion factor stored twice. We have one factor for converting cubic yards to cubic meters spoons, and one for converting cubic meters to cubic yards. Since unit conversion is symmetrical, we can use the one factor for both of those operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve moved from a list of a hundred factors to one with just 55. Each column represents a variable and each row represents an observation. This probably meets the basic definition of a tidy dataset but the information can still be expressed more simply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How I usually think about this criteria is just to ask “If I were entering this data by hand, how could I save effort?” In this case that was easy because I was actually entering the data by hand, but it’s a useful heuristic in lots of cases. Another good question is “if I were storing this data in a database, how might I save storage space?” which pushes you to think about what information you care about, and the best way to store that information. In this case we can remember that every unit has an System Internationale (SI) unit which it can be converted to. This means that we can always convert two units by converting through the SI unit. If we wanted to convert firkins to kilderkins we could first convert firkins to cubic meters and then cubic meters to kildekins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through this process we’ve gone from a matrix with 1000 cells, to a long dataframe with 100 rows, to one with 55 rows, and finally one with just 10 rows. Additionally we can figure whether two units can be converted to one another by just checking whether they have the same base unit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to creating an efficient data storage mechanism, this process creates clairity about how to solve the unit conversion problem. We know that we basically need two functions, one to convert units to their SI counterparts, and another one to convert from the base unit to the target unit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has been my experience with data tidying. Almost every time I tidy data I learn something crucial about how the data should be expressed, and about the problem which I’m trying to solve. This knowledge is invaluable throughout the data analysis process, and cleaning up the dataset is the best way to acquire it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>R for Excel Users</title>

      <guid>/2017/02/02/r-for-excel-users/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Like most people, I first learned to work with numbers through an Excel spreadsheet. After graduating with an undergraduate philosophy degree, I somehow convinced a medical device marketing firm to give me a job writing Excel reports on the orthopedic biomaterials market. When I first started, I remember not knowing how to anything, but after a few months I became fairly proficient with the tool, and was able to build all sorts of useful models. When you think about it, this is an amazing feature of Excel. Every day, all over the world, people open up a spreadsheet to do some data entry and then, bit by bit, learn to do increasingly complex analytical tasks. Excel is a master at teaching people how to use Excel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;R is not like that. I learned to use R as a side project during law school, and it felt a bit like training with an abusive kung-fu master in the mountains of rural China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;../img/pai_mei.gif&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t get R to do anything. It wouldn’t read in files, draw a plot or multiply two numbers together. All I could do was generate mystifying errors and get mocked on Stack Overflow for asking redundant questions. This was all made more frustrating by the fact that I could accomplish all of these things in Excel without much difficulty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the basic pain of learning to program. Programming languages are designed to be general in their application and to allow you to accomplish a huge variety of complex tasks with the same basic set of tools. The cost of this generality is a steep learning curve. When you start learning to do basic tasks in R, you are also learning how to do complex things down the road. As you learn more and more, the marginal cost of complex analyses goes down. Excel is the opposite, and is very easy at the beginning, but the marginal cost goes up with the complexity of the problem. If you were to graph this it might look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;../post/r_for_excel_users_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the beginning, when you are trying to accomplish simple things like balancing a budget or entering some data by hand, R is definitely harder to learn than Excel. However, as the task gets more complex, it becomes easier to accomplish in R than Excel, because the core structures of Excel are designed for relatively simple use cases and are not the best for more complex problems. This isn’t to say that you can’t solve a lot of complex problems with Excel, it’s just that the tool won’t make it easy for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a lot of us, the pain of learning to program feels like the pain of failure. When the program gives you an incomprehensible error message it feels like it’s telling you that you’re stupid and lack programming aptitude. But after programming for a while, you learn that nobody really understands those errors, and everybody feels like an imposter when their program fails. The pain you feel is not the pain of failure, it’s just the pain of learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;../img/learning_not_failing.gif&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;why-is-learning-new-things-so-hard&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why is learning new things so hard?!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difficulty of learning a new tool is caused by two obstacles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;obstacle-1-the-tool-is-different-from-what-you-know&#34; class=&#34;section level4&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Obstacle #1: The tool is different from what you know&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you know how to use something you have this vast amount of basic vocabulary about that tool. I haven’t used Excel seriously for six years, but I can still remember all of its hot-keys, formula names, and menu structures. When you’re learning a new tool you don’t know any of this stuff, and that automatically makes it more difficult. Additionally, you might know where to look to find help on the old tool, or how to Google questions in such a way that you find useful answers. You don’t know any of these things about the new tool, which is painful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;obstacle-2-the-mental-model-underlying-the-tool-is-different-from-your-current-mental-model&#34; class=&#34;section level4&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Obstacle #2: The mental model underlying the tool is different from your current mental model&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way the new tool wants you to think about the problem is different from the way you are used to thinking about the problem. For instance, if you are used to putting your analysis in a rectangular grid, then moving to a tool which is designed around procedural commands is going to be difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my opinion obstacle #2 is by far the larger barrier for Excel users. Most of the people who learn R have some basis in programming. The mental models underlying languages like Matlab or Python, as well as statistical packages like SPSS and SAS, have a lot in common with R, and there are many resources available for translating the bits which don’t make sense. Excel makes you think about analytical problems in a very different way, and there aren’t very many resources for translating the two paradigms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;four-fundamental-differences-between-r-and-excel&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Four Fundamental Differences Between R and Excel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;text-based-analysis&#34; class=&#34;section level4&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1) Text-based analysis&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excel is based on the physical spreadsheet, or accountant’s ledger. This was a large piece of paper with rows and columns. Records were stored in the first column on the left, calculations on those records were stored in the boxes to the right, and the sum of those calculations was totaled at the bottom. I would call this a referential model of computation which has a few qualities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The data and computation are usually stored in the same place&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data is identified by its location on the grid. Usually you don’t name a data range in Excel, but instead refer to it by its location, for instance with &lt;code&gt;$A1:C$36&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The calculations are usually the same shape as the data. In other words if you want to multiply 20 numbers stored in cells &lt;code&gt;A1:An&lt;/code&gt; by 2, you will need 20 calculations: &lt;code&gt;=A1 * 2, =A2 * 2, ...., =An * 2&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Text based data analysis is different:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data and computation are separate. You have one file which stores the data and another file which stores the commands which tell the program how to manipulate that data. This leads to a procedural kind of model in which the raw data is fed through a set of instructions and the output pops out the other side.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data is generally referenced by name. Instead of having a dataset which lives in the range of &lt;code&gt;$A1:C$36&lt;/code&gt; you name the data set when you read it in, and refer to it by that name whenever you want to do something with it. You can do this with Excel by naming ranges of cells, but most people don’t do this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;data-structures&#34; class=&#34;section level4&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2) Data structures&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excel has only one basic data structure: the cell. Cells are extremely flexible in that they can store numeric, character, logical or formula information. The cost of this flexibility is unpredictability. For instance you can store the character “6” in a cell when you mean to store the number &lt;code&gt;6&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic R data structure is a vector. You can think of a vector like a column in an Excel spreadsheet with the limitation that all the data in that vector must be of the same type. If it is a character vector, every element must be a character; if it is a logical vector, every element must be &lt;code&gt;TRUE&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;FALSE&lt;/code&gt;; if it’s numeric you can trust that every element is a number. There’s no such constraint in Excel: you might have a column which has a bunch of numbers, but then some explanatory test intermingled with the numbers. This isn’t allowed in R.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;iteration&#34; class=&#34;section level4&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3) Iteration&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iteration is one of the most powerful features of programming languages and is a big adjustment for Excel users. Iteration is just getting the computer to do the same thing over and over again for some period of time. Maybe you want to draw the same graph based on fifty different data sets, or read and filter a lot of data tables. In a programming language like R you write a script which works for all of the cases which you want to apply it to, and then tell the computer to do the application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excel analysts typically do a lot of this iteration themselves. For instance if an Excel analyst wanted to combine ten different &lt;code&gt;.xls&lt;/code&gt; files into one big file, they would probably open each one individually, copy the data, and paste it into a master spreadsheet. The analyst is effectively taking the place of a &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loop by doing one thing over and over again until a condition is met.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;simplification-through-abstraction&#34; class=&#34;section level4&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;4) Simplification through abstraction&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another major difference is that programming encourages you to simplify your analysis by abstracting common functions from that analysis. In the example above you might find that you have to read in the same type of files over and over again and check that they have the right number of rows. R allows you to write a function which does this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;read_and_check &amp;lt;- function(file){
  out &amp;lt;- read.csv(file)
  if(nrow(out) == 0) {
    stop(&amp;quot;There&amp;#39;s no data in this file!&amp;quot;)
  } else {
    out
  }
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this function does is read in a &lt;code&gt;.csv&lt;/code&gt; file and then check to see if it has more than zero rows. If it doesn’t, it returns an error. Otherwise it returns the file (which is called “out”). This is a powerful approach because it helps you save time and reduce errors. For instance, if you want to check if the file has more than 23 rows, you only have to change the condition in one place rather than in several spreadsheets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s really no analog for these kinds of functions in an Excel-based workflow, and when most analysts get to this point they just start writing VBA code to do some of this work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;example-joining-two-tables-together&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Example: Joining two tables together&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought I’d illustrate these principles by working through the example of joining two tables together in Excel and R. Let’s say that we had two data tables, one with some information about cars and another with the colour of those cars, and we want to join the two of them together. For the purpose of this exercise, we’re going to assume that the number of cylinders in a car determines its colour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;library(dplyr)
library(knitr)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## Warning: package &amp;#39;knitr&amp;#39; was built under R version 3.4.1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;cars &amp;lt;- mtcars
colours &amp;lt;- data_frame(
  cyl = unique(cars$cyl),
  colour = c(&amp;quot;Blue&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Green&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Eggplant&amp;quot;)
)

kable(cars[1:10, ]) #kable is just for displaying the table&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;header&#34;&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;mpg&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;cyl&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;disp&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;hp&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;drat&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;wt&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;qsec&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;vs&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;am&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;gear&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;carb&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;

&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Eggplant&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Excel you would probably do this using the &lt;code&gt;VLOOKUP()&lt;/code&gt; function, which takes a key, and a range, and then looks up the value of that key within that range. I put together an example spreadsheet of this approach &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1K2IqdXX2MoUB4BorRcBcruS7spCvRtDwqXV-4gYAob4/edit?usp=sharing&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Notice that in each lookup cell I typed some version of &lt;code&gt;=vlookup(C4,$H$2:$I$5, 2, FALSE)&lt;/code&gt;. This illustrates a few things. First, the calculation is the same shape as the data, and happens in the same file as the data. We have as many formulas as we have things that we want to lookup, and they are placed right next to the dataset. If you’ve used this approach you can probably remember making mistakes in the process of writing and filling this formula. Second, the data is referred to by its address on the sheet. If we move the lookup table to another sheet, or another place on this sheet, that is going to screw up out lookup. Third, notice that the first entry of the &lt;code&gt;cyl&lt;/code&gt; column in the spreadsheet store in &lt;code&gt;C2&lt;/code&gt; is stored as text, which causes error in the lookup function. In R, you would have to store all the calendar values as a numeric or character vector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do the same thing in R, we would use this code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;left_join(cars, colours, by = &amp;quot;cyl&amp;quot;) %&amp;gt;% 
  filter(row_number() %in% 1:10) %&amp;gt;% # to display only a subset of the data
  kable() &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;header&#34;&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;mpg&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;cyl&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;disp&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;hp&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;drat&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;wt&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;qsec&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;vs&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;am&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;gear&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;carb&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;colour&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;even&#34;&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;19.2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;167.6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;123&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;3.92&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;3.440&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;18.30&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Blue&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we refer to the data by its name, use one function to operate on the whole table rather than row by row. Because consistency is enforced for each vector we can’t accidentally store a character entry in a numeric vector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;iteration-1&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Iteration&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let’s say we wanted to get the mean displacement for each colour of car. Most Excel users would probably do this iteration manually, first selecting the table, sorting it by colour and then picking out the ranges that they wanted to average. A more sophisticated analyst would probably use the &lt;code&gt;averageif()&lt;/code&gt; function to pick out the criteria they wanted to average on, and so avoid a few errors. Both approaches are implemented in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1K2IqdXX2MoUB4BorRcBcruS7spCvRtDwqXV-4gYAob4/edit#gid=364351786&#34;&gt;iteration&lt;/a&gt; tab of the spreadsheet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In R you would do something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;left_join(cars, colours, by = &amp;quot;cyl&amp;quot;) %&amp;gt;% 
  group_by(colour) %&amp;gt;% 
  summarize(mean_displacement = mean(disp)) %&amp;gt;% 
  kable()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;header&#34;&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;colour&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;mean_displacement&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Blue&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;183.3143&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;even&#34;&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Eggplant&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;353.1000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Green&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;105.1364&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this does is takes the data set, splits it up by the grouping variable, in this case colour, then applies the function in the &lt;code&gt;summarize&lt;/code&gt; function to each group. Again, the difference is that we’re always referring to things by name rather than location, there is one line of code which applies the function to the whole dataset, and all of the iterative actions are stored in the script.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;generalizing-through-functions&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Generalizing through functions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Functions are among the more difficult parts of learning to program, and you really can get by for quite a long time without ever learning to use them. I wanted to include them just because they are common and can be quite discouraging for Excel users because they are totally foreign to their workflow. A function is a way of using existing code on new objects. In the case above it might look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;join_and_summarize &amp;lt;- function(df, colour_df){
  left_join(df, colour_df, by = &amp;quot;cyl&amp;quot;) %&amp;gt;% 
    group_by(colour) %&amp;gt;% 
    summarize(mean_displacement = mean(disp))
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The things between the &lt;code&gt;function()&lt;/code&gt; braces (&lt;code&gt;df&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;colour_df&lt;/code&gt;) are called “arguments”, and when you call the function all it does is take the actual objects you supply to the function and plugs them in to wherever that argument appears between the curly braces. In this case we would plug in &lt;code&gt;cars&lt;/code&gt; for the &lt;code&gt;df&lt;/code&gt; argument, and &lt;code&gt;colours&lt;/code&gt; for the &lt;code&gt;colour_df&lt;/code&gt; argument. The function then basically replaces all the &lt;code&gt;df&lt;/code&gt;s with &lt;code&gt;cars&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;colour_df&lt;/code&gt;s with &lt;code&gt;colours&lt;/code&gt; and then evaluates the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;join_and_summarize(cars, colours) %&amp;gt;% 
  kable() &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;header&#34;&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;colour&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;mean_displacement&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Blue&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;183.3143&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;even&#34;&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Eggplant&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;353.1000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;Green&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;105.1364&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;conclusion&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excel users have a strong mental model of how data analysis works, and this makes learning to program more difficult. However, learning to program will allow you to do things that you can’t do easily in Excel, and it really is worth the pain of learning the new model.&lt;/p&gt;
