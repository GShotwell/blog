<p>In a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/20/podcasts/the-daily/black-death-rate-coronavirus.html">recent interview</a>,
Linda Villarosa outlines the three major causes that she and other public health researchers have identified as causes for the huge racial gap in Covid mortality:</p>
<div id="proximity-to-the-virus" class="section level3">
<h3>1) Proximity to the virus</h3>
<p>Black people live and work in environments where the virus is difficult to escape.
They are more likely to work in essential services where it is difficult to engage in social distancing, and they are more likely to live in inter-generational homes in densely populated areas.
All of this leads to more contact with the virus, more contact leads to more infection, and more infection leads to more death</p>
</div>
<div id="racial-bias-in-health-care" class="section level3">
<h3>2) Racial bias in health care</h3>
<p>Black people receive worse health care than white people.
Black patients are less likely to be believed by physicians, essential interventions are more likely to be delayed,
and resources tend to be allocated to white patients.
Naturally, if you get worse health care because of your skin colour, your outcomes are going to be worse.</p>
</div>
<div id="pre-existing-conditions" class="section level3">
<h3>3) Pre-existing conditions</h3>
<p>For a variety of reasons, Black Americans have higher rates of conditions which make Covid-19 more dangerous.
Rates of diabetes, hypertension, and asthma are all higher in Black communities,
which leads to higher Covid-19 mortality.</p>
<p>It’s helpful to draw this model as a graph to show the causal relationshi:.</p>

<p>What bothers me about this this model is that it leads to a pretty fatalistic perspective on Covid mortaliy.
Most of a damage from the Covid pandemic is going to take place over the next 1-2 years, and it’s hard to imagine any of factors changing significantly during that time period.
We’re probably not going to make major changes to our housing or economy such that Black people are not disproportionately proximate to the virus, and it’s unlikely that rates of preexisting conditions can be modified in a year.
It’s possible that bias in health care can be remedied, but I’m unaware of any project that has fixed unconcious racial bias at such a large scale in such a short period of time.
The result is that if you think that this is a complete model of excess Covid mortality, it seems like that excess mortality is already baked into the system, and while tragic it’s not treatable.
Even if these are major causes, they’re not causes that we can realistically modify over the next two years.</p>
<p>I think this pretty dangerous because it leads researchers to effectively triage Black communities.
If we’re certain that these are the only factors, and we’re also fairly certain that they can’t be changed, what’s the point of studying the matter?
Wouldn’t research energy be better spent reducing the overall incidence of the virus, rather than looking at relative differences between groups?</p>
<p>The fact is that we don’t know that much about Covid,
and so it’s possible that this isn’t a complete causal model and there are things that we can change which reduce excess mortality among people of colour.
If we have too much certainty that this excess mortality is socially determined,<br />
then researchers won’t invest time or money trying to figure out things that can be treated.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-vitamin-d-model" class="section level1">
<h1>The vitamin D model</h1>
<p>I’ve been very interested in vitamin D deficiency as a potential cause of Covid-19 mortality because it’s one of the best treatment candidates for widespread use.
Unlike other potential therapies, we have a lot of vitamin D, and we know that it’s safe to consume prophylatically.
Vitamin D would also go a long way to explain people of colour are dying at such high rates in the Northern hemiphere where sunlight is scarce, but not equitorial or southern parts of the world where sunlight is abundant.
While skin colour is not the only factor that changes serum vitamin D, and race is a social category that’s only loosely related to skin colour, it is the case that in most northern latitudes people with darker skin tend to have lower vitamin D levels in the winter.</p>
<p>It’s important to be clear about the causal model I’m proposing.
Nobody is arguing for a model like this one where vitamin D is the only relevant factor.</p>
<div id="htmlwidget-2" style="width:672px;height:480px;" class="grViz html-widget"></div>
<script type="application/json" data-for="htmlwidget-2">{"x":{"diagram":"\ndigraph boxes_and_circles {\n    graph [overlap = true, fontsize = 10,\n         rankdir = LR]\n  # several \"node\" statements\n  node [shape = box,\n        fontname = Helvetica]\n  S [label = \"Person of colour\"]\n  V [label = \"Low vitamin D\"]\n  D [label = \"Excess Covid mortality\"]\n\n  # several \"edge\" statements\n  V ->D S ->V\n}\n","config":{"engine":"dot","options":null}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>
<p>Instead the vitamin D model adds vitamin D to all the other stuff that causes excess mortality. It might look like this:</p>
<div id="htmlwidget-3" style="width:672px;height:480px;" class="grViz html-widget"></div>
<script type="application/json" data-for="htmlwidget-3">{"x":{"diagram":"\ndigraph boxes_and_circles {\n  graph [overlap = true, fontsize = 10,\n         rankdir = LR]\n  # several \"node\" statements\n  node [shape = box,\n        fontname = Helvetica]\n  S [label = \"Person of colour\"]\n  A [label = \"Proximity to virus\"] \n  B [label = \"Pre-existing conditions\"] \n  C [label = \"Health care bias\"]\n  V [label = \"Low vitamin D\"]\n  D [label = \"Excess Covid mortality\"]\n\n  # several \"edge\" statements\n  A->D B->D C->D V->D\n  S->A S->B S->C S->V\n}\n","config":{"engine":"dot","options":null}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>
</div>
<div id="what-does-the-data-say" class="section level1">
<h1>What does the data say</h1>
<p>Of course none of this matters if it turns out that vitamin D is not a factor.
So far there have been two main strategies which point in the direction that vitamin D, or some other unidentified factor which varies by latitude, is involved in Covid-19 mortality.</p>
<div id="controlling-for-social-determinants-of-health" class="section level2">
<h2>Controlling for social determinants of health</h2>
<p>The main strategy statisticians use to identify whether a factor is important is to control for confounding factors.
For instance, someone might suggest that race determines SAT scores by looking at some data and seeing that there’s a correlation between race and SAT scores.
We might respond to this claim by pointing out that different racial groups live in different neighborhoods, and go to different schools, and this probably changes how prepared people are for the test.
If you control for those factors you tend to find that race provides no real information about SAT scores because it’s just a proxy for which school you go to.
The true causal factor is school choice, not race.</p>
<p>By contrast when you do same exercise about arrest decisions you probably would find that race is an independent factor.
Even you account for neighborhood, crime, or time of day you still find that race is an important predictor of arrest because police, consciously or not, tend to arrest people of colour more often.
So when you include race in an arrest model, you tend to find that provides some information, because racism causes arrest.</p>
<p>We should have a strong intuition that the virus itself is not racist.<br />
The only plausible way a virus can distinguish between people is if there’s some genetic trait that makes one person more vulnerable than another, and
it’s not like people of colour in northern latitudes share some genetic factor that the virus attacks.
As a result what we’re looking for is something like the SAT case, we include all the causal variables in our model, and discover that race doesn’t really add much.
If we find that race still provides a lot of information, that indicates that we’re probably leaving out a causal factor.</p>
<p>There are two main studies that have attempted to control for social determinants of health when explaining Covid-19 outcomes:</p>
<p>First, a <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.06.20092999v1.full.pdf">study out out the UK</a> looked at NHS records and Covid-19 mortality.
They controlled for preexisting conditions as well a <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/833959/IoD2019_Infographic.pdf">deprivation index</a> which combines income, employment, premature death, education, crime, barriers to housing, and living environment.
What they found is that after controlling for all of these things Black, Asian, and mixed race people had about twice the Covid mortality risk as white people.</p>
<p>This study confirms two out of the three causal pieces of Villarosa’s model of Covid mortality.
The deprivation index, which captures at least some of the socioeconomic factors which lead people to be more proximate to the virus, was associated with increased mortality,
and preexisting conditions were also found to lead to increased mortality.
But since race still provides a lot of information, we know that there’s a missing factor.</p>
<p>The second study is a <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.12.20099135v1">study of US veterans</a> which found that “Black and Hispanic individuals are experiencing an excess burden of Covid-19 not entirely explained by underlying medical conditions or where they live or receive care.”
The main outcome of this study was positive Covid diagnosis,
and itcontrolled for age, pre-existing condition and whether someone lived in an urban or rural setting.
They found that Black veterans were more likely to be tested than white veterans,
but were about twice as likely to test positive.</p>
<p>This study also controls for two pieces of Villarosa’s model.
It directly controls for pre-existing conditions, but also is a kind of implicit control on medical bias because the main outcome was a positive test.
Logically, caregiver bias is more important the more treatment decisions a caregiver has to make.
Giving birth is a great example, a doctor needs to decide whether to admit someone who might have a dangerous pregnancy, whether to induce, how to monitor fetal heart rate, and at what point to intervene with an emergency C-section.
Bias creeps in at all of these points, doctors might send a Black woman home when they would admit a white women, monitor fetal heart rate less carefully, or intervene in dangerous labour a few minutes later.
Each of these biased decisions endangers mother and child, and it’s a big part of why there’s a big racial gap in infant mortality.</p>
<p>By contrast, Covid diagnosis really only involves the one decision of whether to test or not, and racial bias would tend to lead doctors to undertest Black people.
A doctor might do a Covid-19 test on a white patient with marginal symptoms, while they may send a Black patient with the same symptoms home without a test.
So bias in this case would reinforce, rather than undermine the finding that Black and Hispanic people are at a higher risk of Covid-19 diagnosis, because the more bias there is, the fewer tests they would receive.</p>
<p>Neither of the studies above perfectly control for the features in Villarosa’s model.
It’s possible that the missing piece in the NHS model was biased medical care, and the missing piece in the VA model was proximity to the virus, but it should at least make you suspicious that there’s an important factor which isn’t being accounted for in the standard way of thinking about racial gaps in health outcome.</p>
</div>
<div id="mendelian-randomization" class="section level2">
<h2>Mendelian Randomization</h2>
<p>A <a href="https://nutrition.bmj.com/content/early/2020/05/20/bmjnph-2020-000096">recent study</a> in the BMJ provides a strong argument that that missing factor is vitamin D.
The study uses a technique called mendelian randomisation which requires a bit of explanation.
In the ideal world, we would answer the question of whether vitamin D deficiency increases your risk of dying of Covid by controlling for vitamin D in the model, but we don’t have information about everyone’s vitamin D levels.
Medelian randomization is the idea that if you have information about something which you know is related to thing you wish you had data on, then you can include that as a proxy.
In the case we know that people with darker skin tend to have lower vitamin D levels than people with lighter skin, and that that gets worse as you move north.
In places like Florida where there’s abundant sun, it doesn’t really matter how efficient your skin is at making vitamin D because it’s sunny most of the year.
In places like Wisconsin where the UV intensity is too low to make vitamin D for much of the year, the gap gets bigger.
So this study uses race + latitude as a proxy for vitamin D levels.</p>
<p>The rules of mendelian randomization are that randomizing factor can’t be directly associated with the outcome, and it can’t be associated with other explanatory factors.</p>
<p>So if you think the causal graph looks like this, mendelian randomization is appropriate:</p>
<div id="htmlwidget-4" style="width:672px;height:480px;" class="grViz html-widget"></div>
<script type="application/json" data-for="htmlwidget-4">{"x":{"diagram":"\ndigraph boxes_and_circles {\n  graph [overlap = true, fontsize = 10,\n         rankdir = LR]\n  # several \"node\" statements\n  node [shape = box,\n        fontname = Helvetica]\n  S [label = \"Person of colour\"]\n  A [label = \"Social determinants of health\"] \n  V [label = \"Low vitamin D\"]\n  D [label = \"Excess Covid mortality\"]\n  L [label = \"Northern Latitude\"]\n\n  # several \"edge\" statements\n  A->D  V->D\n  S->A S->V\n  L->V\n}\n","config":{"engine":"dot","options":null}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>
<p>This study found that excess mortality went up as you went North.
Places like Alabama which we typically think of as having bad racial health outcomes, had lower excess Covid mortality than places like Wisconsin.
This is a pretty good argument for vitamin D’s involvemnt, because it’s hard to find a story where latitude modifies other inputs into the Covid mortality.
This isn’t to say that there’s no such story, but the most obvious one is that vitamin D deficiency increases risk of Covid-19 complication.</p>
<p><img src="/img/excess_aa_mortality.jpg" /></p>
<div id="does-latitude-change-modify-sdh" class="section level3">
<h3>Does latitude change modify SDH?</h3>
<p>Mendelian randomization is not appropriate if the proxy also acts on your other predictor variables.
For instance you might think that because there are fewer Black people in Wisconsin than Goergia, there are also fewer Black doctors, and so implicit racial bias might be worse.
If that were the case latitude wouldn’t give you much information about vitamin D, because it could also be acting on the other social determinants of health which we already know are important.</p>
<div id="htmlwidget-5" style="width:672px;height:480px;" class="grViz html-widget"></div>
<script type="application/json" data-for="htmlwidget-5">{"x":{"diagram":"\ndigraph boxes_and_circles {\n  graph [overlap = true, fontsize = 10,\n         rankdir = LR]\n  # several \"node\" statements\n  node [shape = box,\n        fontname = Helvetica]\n  S [label = \"Person of colour\"]\n  A [label = \"Social determinants of health\"] \n  V [label = \"Low vitamin D\"]\n  D [label = \"Excess Covid mortality\"]\n  L [label = \"Northern Latitude\"]\n\n  # several \"edge\" statements\n  A->D  V->D\n  S->A S->V\n  L->V L->A\n}\n","config":{"engine":"dot","options":null}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>
<p>One quick check we can do to see if this graph makes sense is to look at infant mortality data by latitude.
If excess infant mortality was higher in Northern states than Southern ones, that would suggest that latitude acted on social determinants of health.
This data from the CDC shows that children of Black or African-American mothers die at a rate 2-3 times higher than the children of white mothers, this rate doesn’t really change by latitude.</p>

</div>
<div id="does-latitude-act-directly-on-mortality" class="section level3">
<h3>Does latitude act directly on mortality</h3>
<p>The other way that mendelian randomization can be invalid is if the proxy acts directly on the outcome variable.
In this case that would mean that latitude directly increased excess Covid mortality.
At first glance it’s hard to think of how this would happen, but if you add testing to the model it becomes a bit clearer.
If Southern states have worse testing, and in particular are less likely to test Black people, Covid deaths would be misclassified as some other kind of mortality.
The result would be that excess mortality would <em>look</em> lower, because Covid deaths among Black people were being undercounted.</p>
<div id="htmlwidget-6" style="width:672px;height:480px;" class="grViz html-widget"></div>
<script type="application/json" data-for="htmlwidget-6">{"x":{"diagram":"\ndigraph boxes_and_circles {\n  graph [overlap = true, fontsize = 10,\n         rankdir = LR]\n  # several \"node\" statements\n  node [shape = box,\n        fontname = Helvetica]\n  S [label = \"Person of colour\"]\n  A [label = \"Social determinants of health\"] \n  V [label = \"Low vitamin D\"]\n  T [label = \"Better testing\"]\n  D [label = \"Excess Covid mortality\"]\n  L [label = \"Northern Latitude\"]\n\n  # several \"edge\" statements\n  A->D  V->D\n  S->A S->V\n  L->V \n  L->T T->D\n}\n","config":{"engine":"dot","options":null}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>
<p>I don’t have access to any data that shows testing by race and state, but we can look at the overall testing rate to see if that varies by latitude.
The intuition here is that in places with abundant testing, racial bias would be less of a factor than in the places with scarce testing.
Again there doesn’t look to be much of a relationship here.</p>

<div id="conclusion" class="section level1">
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>To reiterate, this is not to dispute the factors that Villarosa proposes.
None of the papers about vitamin D and Covid challenge the idea that health care bias, pre-existing conditions, and proximity to the virus are major causes of excess mortality, and in fact all of the data supports that conclusion.
What this does challenge is the idea that that’s the whole story, it seems like excess Covid mortality among people with darker skin is not completely explained by socioeconomics, location, or pre-existing medical condition,
which is good news because that means that there may be something we can do about it.
Vitamin D is a good candidate for that missing piece because it helps to explain why latitude would increase the racial gap in Covid mortality.</p>
