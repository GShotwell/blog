<p>The New York Times had a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/03/world/asia/coronavirus-spread-where-why.html?referringSource=articleShare">recent piece</a> about the puzzling ways that Covid-19 has spread across the world.
In it they articulate a number of possible theories about why Covid-19 has effected some countries more than others, but I think they left out one potential explanation: Vitamin D status.</p>
<div id="the-story-so-far" class="section level1">
<h1>The story so far</h1>
<p>So far the story we’ve been told about Covid-19 is that it is an extremely dangerous virus that spreads exponentially, and the only way to contain it is to engage in fairly radical national shutdowns to flatten the curve.
Countries that take immediate, strong action, will have easier disease courses, while countries that don’t will have overwhelmed health care systems and much higher death rates.
I have been, and continue to be, a supporter of this story, but I have to admit that there are quite a few data points which really don’t fit this narrative.</p>
<div id="a-tale-of-two-countries" class="section level2">
<h2>A tale of two countries</h2>
<p>Canada and Australia have had pretty similar Covid timelines.
They both had their first case at the end of January, and hit a hundred cases around mid March.
They are similarly sized countries with similar demographics, and both have robust testing infrastructure.
Despite this, Australia has 3.6 deaths per million people, while Canada’s rate is twenty times as high.</p>

<p>The story that you’re likely to hear from the Australian government is that their response was timely and effective, and because of this they were able to prevent widespread infection.
However, when you look at the timelines of policy changes between the two countries they’re almost identical.
They were both adjacent to large outbreaks.
Canada shares a border with the United States, while Australia had direct, un-screened flights from Wuhan until late January.
They both enacted screening and quarantine policies which were unable to wholly prevent disease importation or community spread,
and they both enacted similar social distancing regulations around the same time.
For example Australia cancelled University classes in the third week of March, while most Canadian provinces closed schools in mid march.</p>
<p>Despite all this, the countries ended up with extreme differences in death rates.
For example I live in Nova Scotia, a small province of 900,000 people, which has almost as many deaths (31) as New South Wales (39).
NSW has eight times as many people as Nova Scotia, relatively higher density, and an outbreak which started two months earlier.
So what the hell is going on?</p>
<p>There are a few good theories for the difference including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Heat preventing viral transmission</li>
<li>Australia’s Aged Care system being better than Canada’s</li>
<li>Luck</li>
</ul>

<div id="the-case-for-vitamin-d" class="section level2">
<h2>The case for vitamin D</h2>
<p>One that hasn’t gotten enough attention though is vitamin D status.
Most people get their vitamin D through their skin, and your skin can only manufacture vitamin D during the summer if you’re far from the equator.
Since Covid started at the end of Canada’s winter and Australia’s summer, vitamin D levels are would be in much lower in Canada.</p>
<p>There’s some preliminary (preprint) research that supports this theory:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3571484">restrospective study</a> in the Philippines found a significant association between vitamin D status and severe Covid infections.</li>
<li>An <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3585561">Indonesian</a> study of 712 people found that after controlling for age, gender, and co-morbidity, vitamin D deficiency as associated with a twelve times higher risk of death</li>
<li>Covid-19 appears to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32311755">vary by latitude</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally there are some other factors that make vitamin D a plausible candidate:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vitamin D helps regulate the <a href="https://youtu.be/Nfp4X4O87DQ?t=1499">renin angiotensin system</a> which includes the ACE2 receptor that Covid-19 binds to.</li>
<li>Vitamin D deficiency is common among populations at risk for Covid-19 mortality, including people of colour, the elderly, obese, health care workers, and those in institutional settings.</li>
<li>Vitamin D reduces the risk of <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/356/bmj.i6583">other</a> acute respiratory infections.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lastly vitamin D would explain some other puzzling phenomena:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why hasn’t the disease been worse in places like India or Africa with relative constrained public health resources?</li>
<li>Why are people of colour at such a <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-racial-divide-of-covid-19-patients-in-us-grows-even-starker-as-new/">high risk</a> for severe Covid in northern latitudes, but not southern ones? Maybe this is racism, but don’t they have racism in Australia and South Africa?</li>
<li>Why is Louisiana doing better than New York?</li>
<li>With all the old people in Florida, why isn’t Florida doing worse?</li>
</ul>
<p>Now I’m not saying that vitamin D is definitely the cause of differential Covid-19 mortality,
it’s quite likely that there’s some bundle of explanations for all of the above. But given that it’s an abundent, safe, and well understood therapy, I think we should be paying attention to it.</p>

<div id="how-to-verify-this-theory" class="section level2">
<h2>How to verify this theory??</h2>
<p>If the vitamin D thesis is right, we should see a few things:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Positive results from some of the controlled <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04334005">clinical trials</a></li>
<li>Southern US states with bad public policy responses like Florida and Georgia should see lower than expected death rates</li>
<li>By July, we should see Covid-19 outbreaks with high mortality rates in places like Argentina, Tasmania, and New Zealand</li>
</ol>
