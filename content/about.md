My name is Gordon Shotwell I'm a lawyer and R developer in Halifax Nova Scotia. I''ve helped non-profits, web properties and correctional facillities understand their data in order to make better decisions. I'm the author of [a couple](https://github.com/GShotwell/) of R packages and one [meditation app](http://app.shambhala.org/), and have helped non-profits, web properties, and correcitonal facillities understand their data in order to make better decisions. 

My particular interests include demystifying statistical programming, mediation, and legal technology. Iâ€™m always open to hearing about new career opportunities so please [get in touch](g.e.shotwell@gmail.com), I'd love to hear from you.
