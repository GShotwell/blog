My name is Gordon Shotwell. I'm a lawyer and R developer in Halifax, Nova Scotia. I'm currently a data scientist at [Socure](https://www.socure.com/) and have helped non-profits, web properties, and correctional facilities understand their data in order to make better decisions. 

My particular interests include demystifying statistical programming, meditation, and legal technology. Iâ€™m always open to hearing about new opportunities so please [get in touch](mailto:g.e.shotwell@gmail.com), I'd love to hear from you.
