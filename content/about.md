My name is Gordon Shotwell. I'm currently a data scientist at [Socure](https://www.socure.com/) and have helped non-profits, web properties, and correctional facilities understand their data in order to make better decisions. 

These days I'm particularly interested in demystifying statistical programming, data science software quality, and organizational behaviour. Iâ€™m always open to hearing about new opportunities so please [get in touch](mailto:g.e.shotwell@gmail.com), I'd love to hear from you.
